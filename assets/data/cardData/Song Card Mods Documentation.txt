Hi, it's your dope little boi, demo here, and here is some cool little info that will help you understand exactly how these files work





-GETTING STARTED-

Alright, so first things first, you will have a file named "example-card-data.json" within this folder!

Inside this folder will have 7 different variables you can play around with!

The following variables being:
- customArt
- font
- playerIcon
- opponentIcon
- playerOffset
- opponentOffset
- cardAlpha

Now, this may seem a bit complicated, but it's actually SUPER simple to understand and use after reading this txt file entirely :)





-CREATING A CUSTOM CARD-

Okay, first things first, you'll notice that all the songs will by default load in:
- a black box 
- VCR OSD Mono as the font
- reuses your health bar's existing icons

How do you customize it?

Well, setting it up is SUPER easy!

Here's a step-to-step guide to setting it up:

1) Create a copy of the template json file and rename it after the song you want this card to load in (for example: satin-panties.json) [NOTE: it's just like naming a chart file for a song, keep that in mind!]

2) Start playing with the variables given to ya!

3) Save the file, load up the song, and your final custom card will appear in front of you upon startup of the song you wanted it on

Simple, right?





-VARIABLES AND WHAT THEY DO-

customArt - Replaces the default black box card with the name of the image you want (your image MUST be in the following directory: "assets/images/menus/Funkin_avi/card")

font - Replaces the default font file (vcr) with the font you want it to use (your font MUST be a .ttf or .otf file AND be in the following directory: "assets/fonts")

playerIcon - Replaces the BF/Player icon loaded from the BF character in-game with your custom icon (Example: "mom", Directory: "assets/data/characters/mom") [IMPORTANT: YOUR CHARACTER FILE MUST HAVE AN IMAGE NAMED "icon.png" OR YOUR GAME WILL CRASH]

opponentIcon - Does the same as "playerIcon" but for the Dad/Opponent Icon

playerOffset - Replaces the default icon offset for the BF/Player Icon with your custom values (Example: [500, 500])

opponentOffset - Does the same as "playerOffset" but for the Dad/Opponent Icon

cardAlpha - Sets the alpha value of your custom card when it shows up (Example: [0.75])





Alright, that's all you need to know, happy modding!
